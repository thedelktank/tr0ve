                <h3>I received my Bachelor's in Film and Media from the University of Utah in December 2022. While attending the U and getting my degree, I also chose to enroll myself in a coding bootcamp. Through this 
                    coding bootcamp is where I found my passion for all things IT and software engineering. I love video games, making videos, going to music festivals, and stopping at nearby cafes to read.
